This elicitation exercise consists of 2 rounds.  

You will be asked to provide 80% prediction intervals and your rationale behind the lower and upper values. There are a total of four questions. You are being asked to predict:  

_The average annual, unmitigated rate of **residual (R)** growth (%) in each of the following service areas between 2022 and 2042:_ 

- _a) Outpatient attendances (**including** outpatient procedures)_

- _b) Elective admissions_

- _c) A&E attendances (type 1 units only)_ 

- _d) Non-elective admissions (**excluding** maternity and birth episodes)_

### Round 1 

- Check the last part of the URL matches the team you have been assigned to. If you are unsure, please ask.  

- Review the description for each service area. 

- Provide your rationale which explains your surprising low and high value in the corresponding free text box. We want realistic, plausible, surprising values. We donâ€™t want unrealistic, implausible, extremely surprising values.  

- Use the slider to select the lower and upper % values of your prediction interval based on the theory you have provided.  

- When prompted by the facilitator, click next to go to the next question.  

- Once you have finished the final question, you can click complete. 
 

At the completion of Round 1, any predictions where the slider is left unchanged from its default position will not be visible to other participants during round 2. However, you can review all your responses (including those left at default values) in Round 2.
