We are asking for your 80% prediction interval for the average annual, unmitigated rate of **RESIDUAL (R)** growth (%) in **elective admissions** between 2022 and 2042.  

An **Elective Admission** is one that has been arranged in advance. It is **NOT** an emergency admission, a maternity admission or a transfer from a hospital bed in another health care provider. Our unit of interest is the count of admissions, NOT bed days.  

_**Includes** day cases; ordinary overnight elective admissions; and regular day/night attenders._
