@Josh - instructions for phase 2 here

In Round Two, which is the final stage, you will see how your original judgements compare with those of your peers.
The purpose of Round Two is to provide you with further data for you to thoughtfully reflect upon before deciding your final forecast.

- There is now an additional chart which shows your forecast (as a blue line) compared to every other forecast. To view the comments, hover your cursor over the end points of the lines. 

- If you do edit your forecast, you will see a vertical yellow band change as you adjust your forecast. This allows you to see how your revised forecast compares with the forecasts of your peers whilst keeping your original forecast (blue line) visible.
