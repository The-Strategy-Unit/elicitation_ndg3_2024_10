### Round 2 

The purpose of Round 2 is to provide you with further data for you to thoughtfully reflect upon before deciding your final prediction. 

-	For each question, there is now an additional chart which shows your prediction interval (as a horizontal blue line) compared to the prediction intervals of your team members (grey lines). To view the free text comments, hover your cursor over the end points of the lines. 

-	If you do edit your prediction interval, you will see a vertical yellow band change as you adjust the values. This allows you to see how your revised prediction compares with the predictions of your peers whilst keeping your original prediction (blue line) visible. 

If you feel unable to provide a prediction interval for a particular question, you can set the sliders to the maximum values (the default position). You can indicate why you have opted to do this in either of the free text boxes in that question. At the end of Round 2, any prediction intervals which are set to the default position will not be included in the aggregation of the final results.
